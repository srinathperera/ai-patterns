Pattern Extraction Prompt
=========================================================
You are an AI design pattern mining expert.

Extract all **true AI design patterns** mentioned in the following research text. Ignore general software engineering, DevOps, or data engineering patterns.

For each pattern, include:
- Pattern Name :str
- Problem :str
- Context :str
- Solution :str
- Result :str
- Related Patterns :str
- Category :str
- Uses: str
- Thinking: Explain briefly how you identified this as an AI design pattern from the text.

Categories field must be one of the following: 
1. Classical AI
2. Generative AI
3. Agentic AI
4. Prompt Design
5. MLOps (only if specific to ML workflows, not general deployment)
6. AI–Human Interaction
7. LLM-specific
8. Tools Integration
9. Knowledge & Reasoning
10. Planning
11. Personalization

Return only a JSON array. Do not include markdown, extra text, or commentary.

following is a list of patterns and thinking on how it was extracted in JSON format and paper text from which those patterns were extracted. 
Look for any patterns that are not identified from the paper. If there are any missing design patterns from the paper text, extract them as well and add to the below json array.
if there is any issue with bellow json format, correct it and return only the json array.
